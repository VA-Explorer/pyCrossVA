# pyCrossVA

Package currently includes 4 functions:
- InSilicoVA
- InterVA4
- InterVA5
- Tariff2

*InSilico has '.' for n/a fields and due to the differences in ways missing data is read for python and R, *0.001* is given in R for python to differentiate n/a from NaNs. (Just for InSillicoVA) 

*Guide for data entry.xlsx*  was referenced for tariff2
*who_va_output.csv* is a sample data from the original CrossVA package
*odkDownload.csv* is another sample data that is simulated
